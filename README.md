# MAC_DPIManager

A native macOS utility to enable or disable HiDPI (Retina scaling) display modes on external monitors.  
Built with **SwiftUI** and **IOKit**, this app makes it easy to manage display resolutions, and apply font smoothing preferences — all through a modern, clean GUI.


> Note: On recent macOS updates, HiDPI modes matching a display’s native resolution (especially on Apple displays like the Pro Display XDR) may not appear after reboot. macOS typically offers HiDPI scaling only for resolutions below native and may reject custom overrides on managed displays like the Pro Display XDR, limiting options to Apple-approved presets

## 📸 Features

- 🖥️ Detect connected displays with VendorID & ProductID.
- 📏 Enable **HiDPI (Retina scaling)** modes for selected displays.
- 📝 Support for **predefined** and **custom resolutions**.
- 🎨 Optional selection of display icons.
- 🔠 Adjust **Font Smoothing** settings (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3) on the fly.
- 💻 Supports both **Apple Silicon (arm64)** and **Intel Macs**.
- 🔐 Runs required privileged commands safely via `osascript` authentication prompts.
- 📦 Clean, native **SwiftUI** interface.

## 📥 Installation

1. Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Harsh6628/MAC_DPIManager/releases/download/v1.0.0/DPIManager.zip).
2. Extract & Move the `.app` bundle to your `/Applications` folder.
3. Launch the app — you may need to grant permissions to run it the first time.
> ⚠️ **Important**
>
> This step is necessary because the app has not been notarized by Apple due to the membership fees of the Apple Developer Program.  
> If you see a message like  **“Apple could not verify ‘DPIManager.app’ is free of malware”**, it refers to the **lack of notarization**, not to any detected issues or anomalies.

4. For enabling/disabling HiDPI, you’ll be prompted for your administrator password.

- **Disabling HiDPI removes those override files.**
- A **system reboot is required** for changes to take effect.
